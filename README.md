# lazy

I've been reading about optimial evaluation, using interaction nets:
"The Optimal Implementatin of Functional Programming Languages", Asperti & Guerrini.

Thought I should first refresh my memory about standard lazy evaluation, via graph reduction:
Quick re-read of chapters 10, 11 and 12 of SPJ's "The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages"
